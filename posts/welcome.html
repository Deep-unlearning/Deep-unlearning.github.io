            <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
            <div class="post-date">February 2, 2026</div>

            <p>Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to finally have a space where I can share my thoughts, experiments, and insights about artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>This blog will cover a variety of topics related to AI and technology:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Deep Dives:</strong> Detailed explorations of machine learning concepts and algorithms</li>
                <li><strong>Project Updates:</strong> Updates on my personal projects and experiments</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Notes:</strong> Things I learn along the way that might help others</li>
                <li><strong>Research Insights:</strong> My take on interesting papers and developments in the field</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why "Deep Unlearning"?</h2>
            <p>The concept of unlearning in machine learning fascinates me. Just as neural networks learn patterns from data, understanding how they can selectively "forget" or unlearn specific information is crucial for privacy, security, and model maintenance.</p>

            <p>Beyond the technical meaning, "unlearning" also represents being open to questioning assumptions and updating our understanding when presented with new information.</p>

            <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
            <p>I'm always interested in connecting with fellow AI enthusiasts and researchers. Feel free to reach out or follow my work on <a href="https://github.com/Deep-unlearning">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>Stay tuned for more posts!</p>
